Advantages
----------
- Cucumber.
- Very informative report.
- Launch automation scripts on different environment and user.
- Unlimited threads but not more than feature files.
- Reusable steps.
- If you have failed automation scripts it will be relaunched and added into Allure report into "Retries" tab.

Comments
--------
- If the tests stop running, don't worry, tests for checking filters are most likely running, sometimes it takes more than 100 requests to do this.
- If we use CI/CD tool, Allure report will be more informative.
- Library allure-cucumber4-jvm is using Slf4j. Slf4j is using Log4j, Slf4j was excluded. A new version slf4j with log4j2 was added.
- Apache Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides many of the improvements available in Logback while fixing some inherent problems in Logbackâ€™s architecture.
